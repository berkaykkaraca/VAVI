    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Blind Assist is a mobile application designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings safely and independently. 
       Using real-time image processing and artificial intelligence, the application analyzes the user's environment and provides essential audio guidance.</p>
    <p>The application operates by utilizing the smartphone's camera to scan the surroundings. If an object is detected near the user, the app immediately generates an audio alert, ensuring that the user is aware of potential obstacles. More importantly, the application provides step-by-step navigation assistance for visually impaired users who need to reach a specific destination. For example, if a user is inside TED University and wants to go to the Human Resources department, the app will guide them with precise directions such as "Turn right," "Go straight," "Use the elevator and go to the 2nd floor," ensuring a smooth and safe journey.</p>
    <p>Blind Assist is designed with key features to enhance accessibility:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Warns users about nearby obstacles, reducing the risk of accidents.</li>
        <li>Provides real-time navigation assistance in structured environments like universities, offices, and shopping malls.</li>
        <li>Recognizes and identifies key objects, including stairs, doors, elevators, and human presence, allowing users to make informed decisions.</li>
        <li>Uses advanced AI-driven image recognition to create a detailed 3D map of the surroundings.</li>
        <li>Ensures a user-friendly voice-guided experience tailored to visually impaired individuals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By integrating cutting-edge technology, Blind Assist aims to provide an innovative and practical solution to improve the mobility and independence of visually impaired individuals. Our goal is to make navigation safer, more accessible, and more intuitive for users worldwide.</p>
